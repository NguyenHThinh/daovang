            The team that built the game Treasure Hunters are all young people who soon access and inherit all modern technology, wanting to upgrade a game genre that is already very familiar to players but in a completely different style. All items and characters in the game are digitized using advanced Blockchain technology in the form of NFTs. Hopefully, it will bring players a completely new and exciting experience.
